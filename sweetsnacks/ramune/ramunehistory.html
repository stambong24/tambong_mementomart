                Ramune is a drink from Japan, however its development can actually be traced back to England in 1872, where Hiram Codd — an inventor — had patented the codd neck bottle. This bottle allowed liquid to stay inside without leaking out using a glass marble. The design and drink was then brought to Japan by Alexander Cameron Sim, after he travelled to Kobe. Actually, Ramune was originally marketed as a drink that was effective in preventing cholera. Ramune is derived from the Japanese version of the word “lemonade”.

                The original flavour of Ramune is lime-lemon, but over 57 flavours have been introduced since. Some of these flavours include peach, melon, cola, and bubble gum. Ramune may also come in specialty packaging, courtesy of brand collaborations with popular characters such as Hello Kitty, and franchises like Pokemon. Fun fact: the original Ramune was actually called “mabu soda”.

                Ramune is widely associated with Japanese summer fireworks festivals, as it is popular for its refreshing flavour. Many stalls at these festivals will be seen selling Ramune, and the glass bottles can also be recycled, which is an obvious plus! In 2006, a new version of the Ramune bottles was introduced with small slots added to the cap, which prevented blocking the flow of the drink, in case the marble fell into the cap. This made it easier to drink, especially for those unfamiliar with it. Ramune day is celebrated on May 4th every year.

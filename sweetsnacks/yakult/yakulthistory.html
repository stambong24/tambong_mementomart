                Yakult is a sweetened probiotic milk drink from Japan. It is fermented with the Lactobacillus casei Shirota bacteria strain, and is sold by Yakult Honsha in Tokyo. In 1935, Yakult began its production after Minoru Shirota strengthened and cultured the bacteria in 1930. Shirota discovered that lactic acid bacteria suppress harmful bacteria in the intestines. With a team of colleagues, Shirota used the lactic acid bacteria to create a fermented milk drink that was both affordable, and delicious, in order to help maintain the health of many people.

                In 1963, Yakult launched its delivery service, in which “Yakult Ladies” would distribute the product to consumers to reach a wider audience. The drink has since expanded all over the world, but is especially popular in the rest of Asia. According to the official website, it is recommended that a person drinks one or two bottles of Yakult a day, and the benefits of doing so include consuming lots of probiotics. Fun fact: the Yakult company works with doctors, scientists, and dieticians all over the world to help people with medical conditions, using their probiotics. They have contributed to many medical advances in both the probiotics field, and beyond.

                Yakult is iconic for not only its taste, but its branding as well, due to its distinct shape and colours. The bottles may be small, but it is this unique style of packaging that makes the drink so memorable. Fun fact, in 2018, Yakult bottles (although unlabelled) were featured in the film To All the Boys I’ve Loved Before, leading to a subsequent rise in drink sales.

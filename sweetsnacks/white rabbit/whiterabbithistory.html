                The creation of White Rabbit candy can be traced all the way back to 1943, when it was developed by the ABC Company in Shanghai. The idea came when a member of the company tried milk candy from Europe, which they took a strong liking to. As a result, they dedicated time to making the milk candy we all know and love today. It was also China’s first milk candy! Surprisingly, the initial version of the packaging featured Mickey Mouse, not the rabbit we all know and love today.

                The shift to the current branding happened as the company decided to rebrand, and make their design represent its country of origin instead. This eventually led to White Rabbit surging in popularity in China. However, over the years, the candy’s popularity has also reached all around the globe, and is sold in over 40 countries. In 2004, the annual sales of White Rabbit reached 600 million yuan.

                White Rabbit candies have become a beloved part of many people’s childhoods. For example, Shanghai native, Terry Yang, states that the sweet treat has an important place in his family’s history, as his grandmother used to sell them and bring them home for her own children. His family has continued this tradition, by buying lots of White Rabbit for every Lunar New Year.

                 <p id="recipe-1-body">1. Toast the sesame seeds, pumpkin seeds, and nuts on a dry pan until aromatic, about 5 minutes.
                    <br>
                    2. Add flour, salt, and baking powder to a large mixing bowl. Whisk to mix. Stir in the beaten egg and knead to form a sticky dough. Cover and let it rest for 30 minutes
                    <br>
                    3. After 30 minutes, dust your working surface and a bit on your palms with some tapioca starch.Knead into a smooth non-sticky dough
                    <br>
                    4. Divide the dough into two. Cut into 3 and then stack them on top of each other. Use a sharp knife to cut into 1/4-inch (5 mm) width noodle strips. Toss them with some tapioca starch to prevent stickiness. Repeat with the other dough
                    <br>
                    5. Fry the dough strips in batches until they float to the top and puffy, about 3-5 seconds or so. Don't overcook them. They should be just lightly golden brown. Repeat with the rest of the dough strips. Keep them warm in the oven while you prepare the syrup
                    <br>
                    6. Mix all ingredients for syrup in a large wok or large deep heavy-bottom pot. Cook over low-medium heat until the mixture is bubbly and foamy, about 10 minutes.
                    <br>
                    7. Immediately stir in the fried dough strips and the seeds mixture and stir to make sure the sticky syrup is coating the dough mixture
                    <br>
                    8. Transfer to the prepared pan and spread them out as much as you can using a spatula and use a piece of parchment paper on top and press them down to pack it down evenly. Let it cool down and then cut into squares.

                 <p id="recipe-2-body">1. In a stand mixer, mix plain flour, eggs, egg yolk, salt, and baking powder and mix on medium speed until full gluten development, wrap the dough with cling wrap and rest in the chiller overnight.
                    <br>
                    2. Roll the dough out to about 0.3cm thin and slice them into strips about 4 cm / 0.5cm.
                    <br>
                    3. Dust with flour to prevent them from sticking. Heat up the frying oil to 170 deg C.

                    4. Fry the dough strips for about 3 minutes. Drip dry and cool completely.

                    <br>
                    6. Lightly toast the black and white sesame seeds at 190 deg C for about 7 minutes or until fragrant, set aside to cool.

                    7. Repeat for the pumpkin seeds.

                    <br>
                    9. When the syrup temperature reaches 110 deg C, remove from heat. Use the syrup when itâ€™s still hot. Mix both the fritters evenly.
                    <br>
                    10. Pour the syrup evenly over the fritters and mix quickly and evenly. Pour and spread onto a parchment lined half baking tray and sprinkle the seed toppings over the top.

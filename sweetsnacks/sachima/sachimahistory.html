                Sachima is a sweet snack from China, made of fluffy pieces of fried batter, mixed together with a sticky sugar syrup, and has been around for centuries. Sachima was actually first made in northeast China, and was originally used as an energy snack for those in the Manchu Army. it is stated that the snack gave the army enough energy and stamina to defeat the Ming Dynasty in the 1600s. In the present day, Sachima is still extremely popular all over China, with variations scattered all across Asia. For example, there is a Cantonese version of the snack that is topped with sesame seeds, dried coconut, or raisins. A similar version of the snack is also made in Vietnam, using puffed grains of glutinous rice, which is then mixed together with sugar and ginger.

                Sachima was also said to be the “emperor food”, and was historically served on important occasions for feasts. The production of the snack itself is quite taxing, however, there are still many that make the snack by hand in their own stalls and shops. The dough is made from flours, eggs, and baking powder, and the fluffy texture is thanks to the use of deep frying instead of baking.

                The magic of Sachima lies in the syrup, as the syrup soaks into each of the fried batter strands. The snack still remains fluffy, and surprisingly doesn’t get soggy at all, making it a satisfying treat. Sachima is then pressed into rectangular molds Fun fact: since 2015, over 66 new Sachima varieties have been created in China!

                The Meiji group was first founded in Japan in 1916, with some of their most popular products being their creative snacks. Hello Panda in particular was first released in Japan in 1979, and went on to also be manufactured in both Singapore and Indonesia. Today, Hello Panda is sold all over the world, including the United States, Australia, Canada, and more!

                The biscuits themselves are unique, as they each feature a different panda participating in fun activities. Some of these include baseball, soccer, football, and even some olympic sports like pommel horse, boxing, archery, fencing, etc. There is a panda for everyone in each box, and it is difficult not to enjoy the experience of eating these cute little snacks.

                The classic Hello Panda biscuits are shortbread biscuits with a crunchy shell, and a chocolate filing. However, it comes in many other different flavours, including strawberry, vanilla, and caramel. Fun fact: in 2014, the company launched the “Find the Golden Panda” game, for Meijis 40th anniversary. The goal of this game was to find a Golden Panda through a downloadable app, rewarding the users with various prizes.

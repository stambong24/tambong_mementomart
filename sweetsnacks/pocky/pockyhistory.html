                Pocky was first created in Japan by Yoshiaki Koma, and sold in 1966. The original version of Pocky is simple with a chocolate coating, but was followed by another version with an almond coating in 1971, and strawberry in 1977. Since then, the variations of Pocky flavours are vast, and there is something for everyone. The treat is especially popular in Japan, but can also be found all over the globe. In 2020, Pocky was acknowledged by the Guinness World Records, being given the title of the “largest chocolate-coated biscuit brand”

                There is actually a “Pocky Day” holiday, which was launched in 2016 to commemorate its 50th anniversary. Pocky day is celebrated on November 11th, to represent both the biscuit’s shape, and the number 1 as well. In its earlier years, pocky sticks were each coated by hand, and the bottom part of the stick without chocolate actually serves a practical purpose — it allows you to eat the snack without getting chocolate on your hands.

                Pocky has since become a source of nostalgia for many people, but it is loved and celebrated by people of all ages. In fact, Pocky can be found almost anywhere. For example, if you go to a rolled ice cream shop, more often than not will there be an option to have Pocky as a topping.

                Pancit Canton, which are said to be “long life noodles”, were first introduced in the Philippines by Chinese immigrants. Since then, different regions in the country have developed their own version of the dish, however many of them share the common ingredient of calamansi — a Filipino citrus. While not exactly the same, the company Lucky Me started selling instant pancit canton in 1991, which turned the beloved dish into stir fried, dry, pouch noodles. It was marketed as the first Filipino flavoured cup noodles.

                In 1999, Lucky Me released a few new flavours, including calamansi, hot chili, and chili-mansi, and instant pancit canton has since become the most popular fried noodle in the Philippines. The first versions that Lucky Me produced however came to be in 1989, where they sold beef and chicken noodle soup in pouches. They later developed the dry pancit canton noodles a few years later. In 2014, Lucky Me was acknowledged as the most purchased consumer brand in the Philippines.

                The name “pancit”, is derived from the Hokkien word “pian e sit”, meaning “something conveniently cooked” — a trust testament to how fuss free instant pancit canton is if you want a quick meal. Pancit was first sold from food stalls and served to factory workers, eventually becoming a street food. Today, pancit is commonly served during special occasions, especially birthdays, as the noodles symbolize a long life.

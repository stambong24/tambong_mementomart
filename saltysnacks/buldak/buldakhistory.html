                Buldak noodles were first produced by the company Samyang Foods in April of 2012. It began with the Hot Chicken flavour ramen, and the ultimate goal when producing this flavour was to make it as spicy as possible. Thanks to the youtube channel “Korean Englishman”, buldak ramen rose to popularity as it became a viral challenge to try and finish a single serving without drinking any type of beverage. Buldak noodles were also a popular choice for korean Mukbangs, which are eating shows in which someone records or livestreams themself eating for an audience.

                Buldak noodles are said to be one of the most spiciest types of instant noodles in Korea, and come in a variety of flavours. Some of these alternate versions include jjajang, cheese, carbonara, yakisoba, curry, etc., and despite the different flavours, they all share a common theme — their intense spice. Samyang even created a X2 spicy version, which as the name suggests, contains double the amount of spice. Samyang also makes other kinds of Buldak products such as their instant tteokbokki, and glass noodles. The ramen series even has a mascot present on each package, a chicken known as “Hochi”.

                The creator of Buldak ramen was inspired after having lunch at a restaurant in which he saw people eating a spicy chicken dish that made them fan their tongues. This eventually led to the ramen’s production, and during its early stages, one worker questioned the spice levels and was unsure if it would sell well. At first, most consumers could not handle the spice, but thanks to the aforementioned Fire Noodle Challenge, their sales spiked exponentially.

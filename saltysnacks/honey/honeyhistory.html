                Honey Butter Chips are a brand of potato chips made in Korea by the company Haitai Calbee, and were first produced in 2014. This snack quickly gained traction through social media, as influencers and celebrities would post selfies of themselves with the chips. For example, Sooyoung of the K-pop girl group Girls Generation shared a photo of herself with a bag of Honey Butter Chips, and commenters were tempted to buy some for themselves. They became so popular, in fact, they started to be difficult to find in stores, and sellers were almost always sold out. Honey Butter Chips became a sort of craze in South Korea.

                The chips are so popular, in fact, that versions of the product appear in games such as Mystic Messenger, leading to even more people wanting to try them out. In 2014, Honey Butter Chips were so rare to find that people began trading/selling them online with inflated prices. Fun fact: in 2023, a bag of these chips on Amazon came close to $56 USD.

                Their popularity can partly be attributed to their flavour, which is a perfect balance between sweet and salty. In Japan, the chips are sold as Happiness Butter Potato Chips, which quite accurately reflects how widely loved these chips are by the people all around the globe. The craze had even come to a point where stores would have waiting lists for customers interested in purchasing a bag for themselves. The popular chips also come in a variety of flavours, including maple syrup, cherry blossom, almond caramel, wedding cake, dulce de leche, and more.

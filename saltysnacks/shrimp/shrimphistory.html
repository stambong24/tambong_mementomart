                Shrimp crackers can most likely be traced back to Southeast Asia — specifically Indonesia, or Malaysia. It is said that leftover crushed prawn heads from a feast were used to make the first kinds of shrimp crackers. Today, they are made from a mixture of prawns, tapioca flour, and water. The dough is then rolled, steamed, and sliced. The slices are then left to sun dry to eliminate any moisture, and make them extra crispy.

                Cooking shrimp crackers consists of deep frying them in extremely hot oil. In seconds, the crackers puff up into fluffy crackers. In Indonesia, prawn crackers are called krupuk udang, and some popular brands include Finna and Komodo. In the Philippines, prawn crackers are called kropek, and are eaten as snacks or appetizers paired with a vinegar based dipping sauce. In Vietnam, shrimp crackers are made of ground shrimp, and may be mixed with cuttlefish. Today, many versions form the chips into oval shapes, which allows you to scoop up accompanying foods like salads.

                Shrimp crackers were initially invented to combat food waste, by using the leftover parts of prawns and shrimp. In the present day, they may be eaten as snacks, or served alongside dishes at restaurants. Shrimp crackers may also have seasoning such as salt, pepper, MSG, and more depending on the flavouring. Fun fact: shrimp crackers didn’t circulate beyond Asia until the 19th century.

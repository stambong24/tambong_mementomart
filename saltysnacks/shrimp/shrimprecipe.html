                 <p>1. Chop prepped shrimp. If frozen, defrost and remove excess moisture with paper towels.
                    <br>
                    2. Combine shrimp with seasoning and water in a blender. Puree the mixture until smooth.
                    <br>
                    3. Mix shrimp paste in a bowl with tapioca starch. Knead for about five minutes until you have a smooth dough (it should not be sticky).
                    <br>
                    4. Form the dough into a log, split it into six pieces, and boil for about 35 minutes.
                    <br>
                    5. Allow the cooked pieces to dry in the fridge overnight.
                    <br>
                    6. Then, slice thinly and place slices in a single layer on a cooling rack. Allow them to sit in sunlight for two days or until they are fully dried/have a crispy texture.
                    <br>
                    7. Store your homemade shrimp chips in an airtight container or bag for up to six months. Ensure you keep them in a cool, dry location.

                <a href=“https://philshomekitchen.org/2018/11/01/spiced-prawn-crackers-youtube-clip/ ”><h1 id="full-recipe-2">original recipe here</h1></a>


                 <p id="recipe-2-body">1. Put the prawns in a food processor and pulse for a few moments until they become a paste. Add the remaining dough ingredients, apart from the water, and pulse for a minute or so until you have a very fine sandy texture.
                   <br>
                    2. Add 50ml water and pulse until you get a thick dough, adding a little more water if necessary: after a few moments of pulsing, the dough will start to come together to form a ball.
                    <br> 
                    3. Turn the dough onto the work surface and knead the dough for a few moments until smooth. Roll into a fat cylinder.
                    <br>
                    4. Wrap the dough cylinder tightly in cling film. Steam for an hour before cooling and then chilling for several hours or overnight, still wrapped in the cling film.
                    <br>
                    5. Cut thin slices from the dough using a sharp knife, cutting to about 1-2mm thick. Alternatively, use a vegetable peeler along its length to give ribbons.
                    <br>
                    6. Dry the slices in a dehydrator set to 60°C for 4-5 hours or until fully dry: alternatively, place them on baking trays lined with parchment and pop in the oven set to 50°C (fan oven).
                    <br>
                    7. To deep-fry them, heat the oil to 190°C and drop several at a time into the hot oil for about 1 minute until puffed up, giving them a turn part-way through.

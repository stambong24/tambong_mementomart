        <p>Unlike the other snacks in this archive, Spam actually originated in America. However, it has since travelled to many parts around the world, particularly in Asia, where the luncheon meat has made its way into the cultural foods of various different countries. Spam can seem unappealing at first, but if there’s one piece of advice to gain from this archive, it's that one should never eat Spam straight from the can. For safety reasons? No, Spam is entirely okay to eat on its own, but it won’t be a great experience, as its true power is revealed when cooked into a proper meal.</p>

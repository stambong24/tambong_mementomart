                Spam is made by Hormel Food Corporation, an American company. Spam actually began as a food during World War II, due to the difficulty of having fresh meat on the war fronts. It became a staple in many U.S soldier diets due to strict rationing. But the question is: why is this considered a staple in so many Asian cultures? This was due to the occupations that followed World War II. Spam made its way to Hawaii, Okinawa, and the Philippines due to American occupation. Similarly, American soldiers would trade goods, including spam, during the Korean War as well. After the the wars, soldiers left incomprehensible amounts of spam behind in the countries they occupied.

                The history of Spam in Asia is heavy, but countries soon started making it their own by creating cultural dishes that catered to themselves — not the American military. For example, a popular breakfast in the Philippines is “spamsilog”, a variation of silog that includes garlic fried rice, fried eggs, and pan fried spam. There is also Spam Musubi, which is a popular snack in Hawaii which consists of Spam on top of rice, wrapped in Nori.

                In South Korea, Spam was used to make kimbap, and budae jigae (army base stew) during the war. Fun Fact: in 2004, South Korea produced and consumed more Spam than anywhere else in the world, excluding the United States. In Hong Kong, spam was also incorporated into dishes like macaroni with fried eggs, sandwiches, and Spam in chicken soups. Furthermore, Spam has become so popular in the Philippines, that there is a tocino flavour of Spam, and Spam is even given as gifts to friends and family on special occasions.

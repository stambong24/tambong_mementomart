                Rice crackers are said to have originated in China during the Han Dynasty, and during the Tang Dynasty, they made their way to Japan. There, they were called Senbei, although the version of Senbei we are familiar with today wasn't developed until the Edo period. Its origin story is as follows: There was a woman named Osen who owned a teahouse. With her leftover dango, she flattened and roasted them, which turned them crunchy and crispy, which was also easy to eat and transport. These crackers ended up becoming extremely popular throughout Japan, and all over Asia as well.

                Senbei are made from glutinous or non-glutinous rice, and are often eaten alongside green tea. The original versions however were fried, thin, and made of wheat, flour, vegetable oil, and potatoes. The taste can vary, as there are savoury flavours, and sweet flavours. For example, during the Edo period, one teashop served soy sauce infused rice crackers, which many people enjoyed. Since then, many different flavours and textures have come into being. For example, there are soy sauce senbei wrapped in nori, black sesame, shrimp, black soybean, yuki-no-yado (meaning “snow roof”, these are rice crackers with white frosting on top which looks like snow), and much more!

                As mentioned before, senbei is commonly paired with tea, and there are a few popular paintings. The first is Genmaicha, a brown rice tea, and soy sauce senbei, which pairs nicely with the more savoury taste of the crackers. There is also matcha tea and nori senbei, as matcha tends to pair well with seafood flavoured senbei. There are also many unique and modern flavours, including curry, fish roe, octopus, and even ice cream sandwiches.

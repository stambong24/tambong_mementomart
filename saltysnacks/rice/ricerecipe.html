                 <p id="recipe-1-body">1. Line two baking sheets with parchment paper or vegetable oil. Combine the soy sauce and mirin for the glaze and set aside.
                    <br>
                    2. Place the rice flour, cooked rice, salt, and oil in a food processor. Run until finely ground.  Next, slowly add the water through the feed tube until the mixture is slightly wet and crumbly.
                    <br>
                    3. Knead to combine into dough. It will feel a little loose but be sure to press it together to keep its shape.  Divide the dough by hand into even sized dough balls.
                    <br>
                    4. Flatten to 6cm in diameter with a rolling pin or heavy, flat-bottomed object (such as a baking dish). If it is too sticky, you can also form the crackers by hand. Peel the plastic off the dough ‘disc’ and set onto the baking sheet. Place the discs about 1/4 inches apart from one another.
                    <br>
                    5. Bake the crackers on one baking sheet at a time for about 8-10 minutes. Flip the crackers with a spatula. Bake again for another 8-10 minutes, or until the crackers start to brown.
                    <br>
                    6. Brush the tops with the soy sauce and mirin glaze. Return to the oven and bake until lightly browned (about 2 to 3 minutes).  Keep a close eye on the crackers to make sure they do not burn.
                    <br>
                    7. They will crisp up as they rest. Store in a container for up to one week. You can also wrap a sheet of cut nori seaweed around a cracker for added flavour.

                 <p id="recipe-2-body">1. In a food processor, pulse rice flour, cooked rice, salt, and oil until you achieve a coarse powder. Then stream in water as you continue to run the food processor.
                    <br>
                    2. Transfer the mixture into a mixing bowl, add furikake seasoning to taste, and toss to combine with a spatula. Using your hands, press together the mixture. It should hold together once pressure is applied, even if the mixture looks dry at first.
                    <br>
                    3. Take golf ball-sized scoops of the mixture, press them between your hands to compress and then form into a ball. Place the ball between 2 sheets of parchment paper and use a rolling pin to flatten it down as much as possible. Gently peel the top layer of parchment paper off and use a cookie cutter or other circular item to cut a circle.
                    <br>
                    4. Transfer the circle onto a nonstick baking mat-lined tray and repeat with the remaining dough.
                    <br>
                    5. Bake for about 10 minutes, flip, and bake for another 8-10 minutes or until golden brown and crisp.
                    <br>
                    6. For the final step, mix together tamari and mirin in a small cup and whisk together to combine. Brush a layer of this glaze on top of both sides of each cracker piece, then sprinkle with sesame seeds. If adding nori seaweed, slice thin, rectangular, and small pieces to wrap around the cracker. You can cut smaller pieces if preferred. Return the crackers to the oven and bake for an additional 3-4 minutes to achieve that perfect crunchy texture and delicious flavour
